# candidate-grader

I need your help in creating an app that would allow me to grade different candidates while we are hiring them.

It should first have a full page with the list of all candidates, and then when I click on a specific candidate I should be able to  get to ther specific page.

On that page, I should have the ability to grad candidate based on these specific criteria:

Self assesment from prevous 2 managers - one section for each - it should alow me to enter the name of the manager and what grade they would gave to use 1-10

Then there should also be a text feld where I can enter comment about that grade.

I'll give you more instructions later on. For now use some dummy names for cnadidates and later we'll connect to actual datbase
